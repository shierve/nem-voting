nem-voting is a typescript / node.js module for using the NEM voting functionalities easily on any project. Created using NEM-library.

1. [Installation](#installation)
2. [Examples](#examples)
3. [Definitions](#definitions)
4. [Technical specification](#specification)

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

to install the npm module on your typescript or node project run:

`npm install nem-voting --save`

the module is made to work together with nem-library, so you should install that too:

`npm install nem-library@1.0.5 --save`

it is important that 1.0.5 is installed since it needs to be the same version than the one in nem-voting

## Examples <a name="examples"></a>

The module exports two main classes: UnbroadcastedPoll and BroadcastedPoll. They represent polls that exist only locally and polls that exist in the blockchain, respectively.

It also exports a PollConstants object with various usefull constants for voting and a PollIndex object for handling indexes other than the public one (public and private), along with some useful functions specified below.

### Creating and Broadcasting a Poll to the blockchain

```typescript
import { PollConstants, UnbroadcastedPoll, BroadcastedPoll } from "nem-voting";
import { NEMLibrary, NetworkTypes, Account, TransactionHttp } from "nem-library";
import { Observable } from "rxjs";

// This function will bootstrap both the internal nem-library for nem-voting and the local one
// if the local version of nem-library and the one in nem-voting don't match then this will give problems
NEMLibrary.bootstrap(NetworkTypes.TEST_NET); // Change to NetworkTypes.MAIN_NET for main net
const testPrivateKey = "c195d7699662b0e2dfae6a4aef87a082d11f74d2bd583f7dec5663a107823691"; // introduce the poll creator private key

const formData = {
    title: "test poll 2.0",
    doe: Date.now() + (60 * 1000 * 60), // Date of ending as timestamp in milliseconds
    type: PollConstants.POI_POLL, // type of vote counting
    multiple: false, // true if multiple votes are allowed
};
const description = "This is the description for the poll";
const options = ["option 1", "option 2"];

// Create poll object
const poll = new UnbroadcastedPoll(formData, description, options);
const account = Account.createWithPrivateKey(testPrivateKey);

// We get the broadcasted poll data, including the poll address and the option addresses
const broadcastData = poll.broadcast(account.publicKey);
// Now we sign and broadcast the transactions
const transactionHttp = new TransactionHttp();
Observable.merge(...(broadcastData.transactions.map((t) => {
    const signed = account.signTransaction(t);
    return transactionHttp.announceTransaction(signed);
})))
    .last()
    .subscribe(() => {
        // The poll is now broadcasted, but we need to wait for all the transactions to be confirmed
        console.log(broadcastData.broadcastedPoll);
    });

```

### Fetching a Poll from the blockchain

```typescript
import { BroadcastedPoll, NEMVoting } from "nem-voting";
import { NEMLibrary, Address, NetworkTypes } from "nem-library";

// This function will bootstrap both the internal nem-library for nem-voting and the local one
// if the local version of nem-library and the one in nem-voting don't match then this will give problems
NEMLibrary.bootstrap(NetworkTypes.TEST_NET); // Change to NetworkTypes.MAIN_NET for main net
const pollAddress = new Address("TCX6LT3Y43IQL3DKU6FAGDMWJFROQGFPWSJMUY7R");

BroadcastedPoll.fromAddress(pollAddress)
    .map((poll) => {
        return poll;
    })
    .subscribe((data) => {
        console.log(data);
    });
```

### Getting the results for a broadcasted poll

```typescript
import { BroadcastedPoll, NEMVoting } from "nem-voting";
import { NEMLibrary, Address, NetworkTypes } from "nem-library";

// This function will bootstrap both the internal nem-library for nem-voting and the local one
// if the local version of nem-library and the one in nem-voting don't match then this will give problems
NEMLibrary.bootstrap(NetworkTypes.TEST_NET); // Change to NetworkTypes.MAIN_NET for main net
const pollAddress = new Address("TCX6LT3Y43IQL3DKU6FAGDMWJFROQGFPWSJMUY7R");

BroadcastedPoll.fromAddress(pollAddress)
    .switchMap((poll) => {
        return poll.getResults();
    })
    .subscribe((results) => {
        console.log(results);
    });
```

### Voting on a poll

```typescript
import { BroadcastedPoll } from "nem-voting";
import { NEMLibrary, Address, NetworkTypes, Account, TransactionHttp } from 'nem-library';

// This function will bootstrap both the internal nem-library for nem-voting and the local one
// if the local version of nem-library and the one in nem-voting don't match then this will give problems
NEMLibrary.bootstrap(NetworkTypes.TEST_NET); // Change to NetworkTypes.MAIN_NET for main net
const pollAddress = new Address("TBW2PIAVJPW7QRHWJ74PA4E36B6FNE7QWGOI3JAF"); // Poll Address
const testPrivateKey = "c195d7699662b0e2dfae6a4aef87a082d11f74d2bd583f7dec5663a107823691"; // Voter private key
const account = Account.createWithPrivateKey(testPrivateKey);

BroadcastedPoll.fromAddress(pollAddress)
    .switchMap((poll) => {
        // It is important to validate that a poll is valid before voting
        if (!poll.validate()) {
            throw new Error("Invalid Poll");
        }
        const voteTransaction = poll.vote(poll.data.options[0]); // get vote transaction
        const signed = account.signTransaction(voteTransaction); // sign transaction
        const transactionHttp = new TransactionHttp();
        return transactionHttp.announceTransaction(signed); // broadcast transaction
    })
    .subscribe((announceResult) => {
        console.log(announceResult);
    });
```
